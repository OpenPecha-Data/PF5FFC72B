The Vase of Immortal Life
The Long-Life Practice of the Vidyādharas, from the Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse
by Jigme Lingpa

Homage to the vidyādharas of immortality!
Here is explained the long life practice of ‘the Vase of Immortal Life’. In an isolated place,
arrange on the shrine a maṇḍala of coloured sand, or a painting, or heaps of rice, depending
on your circumstances. In the centre, on a raised platform, place the longevity vase
in the middle, the long-life pills on the right, the long-life arrow behind, the long-life
alcohol on the left, and the long-life torma in front, with the offerings all around them.
Imagine yourself and the deities1 as indivisible, and follow the Vidyādhara Assembly2 activity
text through till the end of the section Offering Praise. Then open up the recitation
palace.3

Hrīḥ!  I am Padmākara, the vidyādhara with power over life

Around it stretches the mantra garland, from which
özer tröpé tenyö chü
Rays of lights stream out and gather in
gyalwa rigdzin drangsong gi
The vital force and energy of the inanimate and animate universe,
tsechü dü la chü du dril
And the essence of longevity of all buddhas, vidyādharas, and sages,4
bapü buga tsünchö kyang
Concentrating it all into one vital elixir.5
tsepakmépé tim gyi gang
Even the pores of my body are filled with Amitāyuses,
kün kyang bungwa tsang shyik tar
Every one of them reverberating sweetly, like swarming bees,
hrih dra jam la nyenpar drok
With the soft, low sound of hrīḥ:
chimé rigdzin drubpar gyur
I accomplish the state of vidyādhara of immortality.
Imagine this as clearly as you can as you recite it. Then maintain the ‘soft wind’ vase practice
while reciting:

oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra-mahā-guru ayur-jñāna-mahā-punye tsé bhrūṃ nṛ jaḥ sarva-siddhi hūṃ
The Summoning of Long Life6

In this way, summon longevity. Then, after checking it through the long-life divination,9 the
life-force is secured, and the longevity arrow is set, in its receptacle, standing straight
upright:
ah, jung ngé ying su khyampé tsé
Āḥ! When our life-force wanders into the space of the five elements,
yum ngé long du gyetabpé
It is secured within the expanse of the five mothers:
yeshe nga la kyechi mé

ku ngé ying su tsé bepa
Our life is concealed in the space of the five kāyas, and
rik ngé gyalwé kyang mi zik

dharmadhatu benza raksha
dharmadhātu vajra-rakṣa
Recite this, then rest in the state of natural simplicity. Samaya!
The crucial points are to focus on deity, mantra and samādhi. Far superior to any other, this
long-life practice of the vidyādharas, “The Vase of Immortal Life”, appeared in ḍākinī cypher
in the Longchen Nyingtik, so as to prolong the life of the holder of this teaching.
Now the time has come to act for the benefit of beings! Guhya. The sign dissolves.
Long-Life Empowerment
If you wish to grant a long-life empowerment to others, do the following. Perform a cleansing
ritual for the students, eliminate the obstructing forces and meditate on the protection
circle. The students then offer a maṇḍala, after which you should explain the history. Then
the students repeat after you the refuge, bodhicitta, and confession, and the following
prayer:
chimé gönpo pema jung
Padmasambhava, immortal protector,
sok gi jikpé trakpa la
When fear of death arises,
tukjé chenpö nyer gong né
Look upon us with your great compassion,
tsé yi wang dang ngödrub tsol
And grant us the longevity empowerment and accomplishments.
Recite this three times. Then, while purifying the students with the water of the activity vase,
they visualize themselves as Guru Padmasambhava. Above their heads is Amitāyus with his
consort.
nyampar jorwé kha sang né
From the secret space of union
dechen changsem dütsi gyün
A stream of bodhicitta nectar of great bliss flows down,
babpé lü gang dewé nyö
Filling the body and intoxicating it with bliss.
dorjé sok la wang tob mik
Imagine that you receive the empowerment of vajra-life.
Light incense and play music, while bringing down primordial wisdom. Stabilize with:
tishta benza
tiṣṭha vajra
Then, grant the empowerment by placing the long-life vase on their heads.
hrih, nangsi shyönnu bumpé ku
Hrīḥ. Appearance and existence is body of the youthful vase
kyechi dralwé chü kyi tam
Filled with the vital elixir that is free from birth and death.
kalden bu la wangkurwé
By empowering you, fortunate sons and daughters,
chimé dorjé sok drub shok
May you accomplish the deathless vajra life!
Recite the root mantra combined with:
kaya abhikintsa om
kāyābhiṣiñca oṃ
Place the nectar at their throat and recite the following.
hrih, dechen yum ngé bhendha ru
Hrīḥ. In the great bliss of the five consorts’ bhāṇḍas
chimé changsem dütsir khyil
The deathless bodhicitta nectar gathers.
kalden bu la jinpa yi
By giving it to you, fortunate sons and daughters,
kyechi mepé wang tob shok
May you receive the empowerment that is beyond birth and death.
Recite the root mantra combined with:
waka abhikintsa ah
vākābhiṣiñca āḥ
Touch the long-life pills at their hearts.
hrih, tenyö kham dang tob chü pal
Hrīḥ. The elements of the world and the beings within it and the glory of the ten strengths—
yong kyi chü dü tsé rilbu
All their vital essences are gathered in these long-life pills.
rik kyi bu la jinpa yi
Sons and daughters of noble family, by giving it to you,
dorjé sok la wang tob shok
May you receive the empowerment of vajra life.
Recite the root mantra combined with:
tsitta abhikintsa hum
cittābhiṣiñca hūṃ
Finally, seal the empowerment with the summoning of long life. The students make offerings out
of gratitude and vow to keep their tantric vows.
If a compassionate master grants this empowerment
To a devoted student
Exactly in accordance with this text,
Even from the mouth of the Lord of Death himself they will be freed.

Thanks to the fierce power of the vidyādharas’ spells,
Even though curses are cast, there will not be any danger.10
Therefore, consider this as more precious than your own heart.
Protectors of the Sacred Command and their Vajra Brothers and Sisters, samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal!
Sarva maṅgalam.

At the Iron Bridge of Chuwori, the temple11 whose traditions lead to awakening, the Māratika
of this Snowy Land of Tibet, I released the seal of this text, keeping in mind the auspicious
interdependent circumstances for the longevity of the three main Dharma custodians, such
as the supreme and compassionate incarnation who is the lord and universal sovereign of
accomplished adepts and who has mastered the enlightened activities. May virtue abound!12

↑ Literally, the supports for the practice.↑ Tib. Rigdzin Düpa.↑ In other words, the maṇḍala
opens up and is divided into the self-visualisation (bdag bskyed) and the wisdom maṇḍala
that arises in front (mdun bskyed).↑ Skt. ṛṣi.↑ Vital elixir, or 'chü' (bcud) in Tibetan,
is the vital force, quintessence, quality, potency or nutrition, of both living things and
inanimate matter in the environment, like rocks and minerals. According to Dagyab Rinpoche
in Buddhist Symbols, pp. 6-8, "Chü really means 'essence-juice and vigour', or 'contents'.
Originally the word was probably used to describe the qualities of plants or food, but
it is also used in a transferred sense for the pure 'quality' of living beings, environments,
energies, etc." Taking 'essences' to support your life is called chülen— rasāyana—or rejuvenation
practice. There is also the 'chü'—'vital force' of long life: the longevity possessed,
for example, by the vidyādharas and ṛṣis. In the practice, all are fused into one
life-force energy. The Long Life Empowerment says: "Imagine that the vital force of longevity
of the vidyādharas and ṛṣis, who live for aeons... all the constituent elements, the
radiance and presence and pure essence, all the long life and auspiciousness and merits, of
the whole inanimate universe and all the sentient beings living within it, are gathered,
like iron filings swept towards a magnet, and dissolve into you... "↑ Tib. tséguk (tshe ’gugs).↑
The long-life arrow (Tib. mda’ dar/tshe mda’) is not simply a ritual ornament, but
an instrument for making measurements. Before the practice, the arrow is measured, then afterwards
it is pulled to see how long it can be stretched. If there is a noticeable difference,
it means you have accomplished the practice.↑ Tib. rig pa.↑ 'Tsé tra' (tshe pra) is
the long-life divination. Generally 'tra' (pra) is a sign or vision perceived in water or
the sky or often in a mirror. It is a form of divination but not performed with dice or a
māla. Some people, often women, have this gift naturally, without having to develop it through
practice; others simply cannot see the signs. By practising for a week or ten days,
it is possible to acquire the ability, and after some time the 'tra' can even appear in the
mind, directly. How to analyze or interpret the signs is another matter altogether. According
to the Longchen Nyingtik, there is a practice of 'tra' through Tséringma. Here, after
practising the tsédrup and tséguk, we check, through 'tra', to see what the life-span will
be.↑ This means that although others might cast curses upon you that could harm your life,
through the power of the Vidyādharas’ spells, they will be nullified.↑ The Tibetan text
says gandhola.↑ This final line is not found in the Derge and Adzom editions, only in the
Lhasa edition and the Nyingtik Tsapö, which were produced much later.
